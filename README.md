Coding for work

Trying to create a javascript that can extract data from an api given xml file
current progress: thinking of switching to python, since it seems easier, but I have to figure it all out first
Python script done with the help of stackoverflow; able to extract xml data from given url

Current task:

make 'get data from csv.py work again'
figure out how to do search api for old releases

Current problem:
API will not return a xml format
Needs fix
